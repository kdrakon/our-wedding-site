				<b><i>We are so happy to announce that we are getting married!</i></b> Because weddings are difficult to organise and manage, we set up this website so that our guests would have a single source for the necessary information they will need to attend our special day.
				
				<p/>Most likely you would have been directed here because you received an invitation or notice from us. Irrespective, <i>welcome to our website!</i>

				The ceremony is taking place on the <b>2<sup>nd</sup> of November, 2014</b><span id="days-to-wedding"></span>.
				We will have a Catholic service at:
				
				<p class="address">
				<b>St. Cecilia's Catholic Church</b><br>
				<i>23 Byron Street, Wyong NSW, Australia</i><br>
				<i><a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/?q=St. Cecilia's Catholic Church. 23 Byron Street, Wyong NSW, Australia">Google it</a></i>
				</p>
				
				<p/>
				<u>The ceremony will start promptly at <b>2:30 pm</b></u>. There is a small carpark across the road from the church and street parking is also available in the area. <i>Make sure to allow time in case parking ends up being a difficult task.</i>

				Following the ceremony, a reception will be at:
				
				<p class="address">
				<b>Magenta Shores Golf & Country Club</b><br>
				<i>1 Magenta Drive, Magenta NSW, Australia</i><br>

				</p>
				
				<p/>
				<u>A cocktail hour will start at <b>5:00 pm</b></u>. Although we don't expect the ceremony to last until then, everyone is welcome to travel to the reception area soon after. There is a caf&eacute; located at the club where guests can rest and relax before the reception officially begins. A staff member of the club will direct you to the reception area from here.
				
				<p/>
				Dinner, more drinks, dancing, and other activities will follow soon after the cocktail hour, <i>so please make sure to have your travel arrangements from the ceremony and to your accommodation organised</i>.

				Because some of our guests are not from the area, all of the most important locations for our wedding have been included in the following map.

				Click <a target="_blank" href="http://mapsengine.google.com/map/embed?mid=za-NLMZcC4wc.khZzOyetglvc">here</a> to view a much larger and descriptive version.
				You can use this map to plan your trip and travel when attending the ceremony and reception.
				
				<p/>
				We're planning on reserving some accomodation options for our wedding guests at three locations close to the reception. Once we have a clearer idea of how many guests to expect, we will provide information about bookings.
				
				<p/>
				<u>Make sure to keep an eye on this map</u> as we will continue to add important points and markers as we approach closer to the date.

			<section>
				As a couple who have lived together for a while now, we have many of the items that make a house a home. We appreciate that many people will travel great distances to share this day with us. Because of this, we feel that <b><i>your presence is a gift in itself</i></b> and we don't expect anything more. However, if you do still feel inclined to get us something, we have registered at <b>Peter's of Kensington</b> and will have a wishing well at the reception.
